# 🧮 Discount Calculator (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that helps you calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount. The program only applies the discount if it's *20% or more* — otherwise, it returns the original price.

# 💡 How It Works:

1. The user is asked to enter the original price of an item.
2. The user enters the discount percentage.
3. If the discount is *20% or more*, it's applied to the price.
4. The program shows the final price after applying the discount (if any).

# 🛠️ Example

Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied!
Final price: R 75.0

# 📁 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+).
2. Save the code in a file, e.g. "discount_calculator.py".
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file:

python discount_calculator.py

# 🧑‍💻 Who This Is For
